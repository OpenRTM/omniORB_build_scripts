Package: python-omniorb
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: python-omniorb-omg
Description: Python bindings for omniORB
 omniORB4 is a freely available Common Object Request Broker
 Architecture (CORBA) 2.6 compliant object request broker (ORB)
 implementation. It is based on the IIOP communications
 protocol and should be interoperable with any other
 CORBA 2.6 compliant ORB.
 .
 This is the Debian package of omniORBpy, the Python bindings to the
 omniORB libraries.

 Architecture (CORBA) 2.6 compliant object request broker (ORB)
 implementation. It is based on the IIOP communications
 protocol and should be interoperable with any other
 CORBA 2.6 compliant ORB.
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols of python-omniorb as well as
 modules for use with python-dbg.

Description: CORBA OMG standard files for python-omniorb
 omniORB4 is a freely available Common Object Request Broker
 Architecture (CORBA) 2.6 compliant object request broker (ORB)
 implementation. It is based on the IIOP communications
 protocol and should be interoperable with any other
 CORBA 2.6 compliant ORB.
 .
 This package includes the Python files that are necessary to
 fulfil the OMG standard 02-09-07.  It conflicts with
 python-pyorbit-omg since only one package can provide the default
 CORBA bindings.
